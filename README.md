## ⚠ conan-app-launcher is now conan-explorer

This package has been renamed from version 2.2.0 onwards. Use `pip install conan-explorer` instead.

New package: https://pypi.org/project/conan-explorer/

## Quick Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) to
* Start executables contained in packages of the package manager [Conan](https://conan.io/)
* Browse the local package cache
* Search Packages in remotes
* Configure Remotes and Profiles

It is end-user oriented and focuses on using packages, rather then developing them. It can be used on Windows and Linux x64 platforms.

## How to install?

### Prerequisites on Linux

Currently testing and compatibility is only endured for Debian based distros, specifically Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.

1. Pip must be updated to at least pip 20.3, so using a venv like this is recommended:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install conan_explorer
```

2. An x-terminal emulator must be available for "Open Files in cmd" and console based programs for the App Grid. Type "x-terminal-emulator" to get a list of available terminals.

3. To open files with its associated program xdg-open is used:

    sudo apt install xdg-utils

4. Not all Qt6 versions support the Wayland lib of the base system.
  * For Ubuntu 20.04 please execute "pip install PySide6-Essentials==6.4.3" to get the correct Qt6 version
  * For Ubuntu 22.04 please ensure that the system Qt6 packages are available. Simply execute "sudo apt-get install qt6-wayland" on a wayland system, or "sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev" for an X based system.


### With pip from PyPi

    pip install conan-explorer

### From source

After checkout use the command:

    pip install .

## Running

Execute `conan-explorer` if the Python "scripts" or "bin" folder is on your system path, or look it up manually in the site-packages folder. 
You can also assign its icon to it from the site packages folder in **conan_explorer/assets/icons/icon.ico**.

### Main dependencies

* Pyside6 >= 6.4.0
* 1.48.0 <= conan < 2.1

> **Warning** - **Deprecation of Python 3.X**  
> From version 2.0.0 Python 3.6 support will be dropped, having reached end-of-life.    
> From version 2.2.0 Python 3.7 support will be dropped, having reached end-of-life.    

## Toolchain

This project uses Python with Qt as a frontend using the PySide6 integration.
