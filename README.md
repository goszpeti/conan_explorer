## Quick Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a standalone Graphical User Interface (GUI) to
* Start executables contained in packages of the package manager [Conan](https://conan.io/)
* Browse the local package cache
* Search Packages in remotes
* Configure Remotes and Profiles

It is end-user oriented and focuses on using packages, rather then developing them. It can be used on Windows and Linux x64 platforms.

**Main Features**
- compatible with a wide range of conan versions (from 1.24 onwards)
- integrated console for information an packages and config file
- installable with pip

Quicklaunch
- configurable layout (tabs and applications) in the GUI
- list and grid view
- can also open files with their associated default program
- installs all referenced packages automatically
- automatic conan settings resolution for your platform
- uses the default icons of files or can be configured to use custom ones
- quick controls to switch between versions and channels

Local Package Explorer
- view for browsing through installed packages
- understand package settings at a glance from a shortened representation, e.g. Linux_x64_ggc7
- supports copy/paste on file, open in file explorer, copy reference, etc. functions which are often needed in daily Conan workflow

Conan Search
- search for references in selected remotes
- show all existing packages for a reference and their infos
- install package directly via right-click menu

Conan Config
- view and edit your profiles
- view and edit your remotes - with multilogin to the same arifactory server for multiple remotes

## How to install?

### Prerequisites on Linux

Currently testing and compatibility is only endured for Debian based distros, specifically Ubuntu 20.04.

1. Pip must be updated to at least pip 20.3, so using a venv like this is recommended:
    sudo apt install python3-venv
    python3 -m venv .venv 
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install conan_app_launcher

2. An x-terminal emulator must be available for "Open Files in cmd" and console based programs for the App Grid. Type "x-terminal-emulator" to get a list of available terminals.

3. To open files with its associated program xdg-open is used:

    sudo apt install xdg-utils


### With pip from PyPi
`pip install conan-app-launcher`

### From source

After checkout use the command:
`pip install .`

## Running
Execute `conan-app-launcher`, if the Python "scripts" folder is on your system path, or look it up manually in the site-packages folder. 
You can also assign its icon to it from the site packages folder in conan_app_launcher/assets/icons/icon.ico.

### Main dependencies

* Pyside6 >= 6.4.0
* conan >= 1.24.0

> **Warning** **Deprecation of Python 3.6**  
> From version 2.0.0 Python 3.6 will not be supported anymore, because end-of-life support has been reached.

## Toolchain

This project uses Python with Qt as a frontend using the PyQt integration.
An IDE configuration is available for VsCode.

See https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=goszpeti_conan_app_launcher for Static Code Analysis.

## Licenses of used libraries and code

> **Warning** **Change of License to LGPL**
> From version 2.0.0 the project will use the LGPL 3.0 license to cleanly comply with PySide6.
