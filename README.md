## Quick Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a frontend to start executables contained in packages of the package manager [Conan](https://conan.io/). It also contains a local package explorer view, which is handy on Windows to browse short paths and navigate quickly. A Search Dialog for browsing packages is also integrated.

It is end-user oriented and focuses on using packages, rather then developing them. It can be used on Windows and Linux x64 platforms.

Quicklaunch
- configurable layout (tabs and applications) in the GUI
- list and grid view
- can also open files with their associated default program
- installs all referenced packages automatically
- automatic conan settings resolution for your platform
- uses the default icons of files or can be configured to use custom ones
- quick controls to switch between versions and channels

Local Package Explorer
- view for browsing through installed packages
- understand package settings at a glance from a shortened representation, e.g. Linux_x64_ggc7
- supports copy/paste on file, open in file explorer, copy reference, etc. functions which are often needed in daily Conan workflow

Conan Search
- search for references in selected remotes
- show all existing packages for a reference and their infos
- install package directly via right-click menu


## How to install?

### Prerequisites on Linux

Currently testing and compatibility is only endured for Debian based distros, specifically Ubuntu 20.04.

1. Qt for Python must be installed with the native package manager, like:

    sudo apt install python3-pyqt5

2. An x-terminal emulator must be available for "Open Files in cmd" and console based programs for the App Grid. Type "x-terminal-emulator" to get a list of available terminals.

3. To open files with its associated program xdg-open is used:

    sudo apt install xdg-utils


### With pip from PyPi
`pip install conan-app-launcher`

### From source

After checkout use the command:
`pip install .`

## Running
Execute `conan-app-launcher`, if the Python "scripts" folder is on your system path, or look it up manually in the site-packages folder. 
You can also assign its icon to it from the site packages folder in conan_app_launcher/assets/icons/icon.ico.

### Main dependencies

* PyQt5 >= 5.13.0 
* conan >= 1.24.0

## Toolchain

This project uses Python with Qt as a frontend using the PyQt integration.
An IDE configuration is available for VsCode.
